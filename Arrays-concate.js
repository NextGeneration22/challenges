     // Explanation of how the code works:
// Line 1 and 2: Initialize two arrays, myArray and anArray.
// Line 3: Set a variable l to the length of myArray, and line 4: Set a variable s to the length of anArray.
// The for loop uses two conditions: the first condition is used to iterate through myArray, and the second condition is used to iterate through anArray.
// How the for loop works:
// Starting with the value of 'i' from 'l' and the value of 'j' from 0:
// When i = l, j will be 0, resulting in the following:
//                  -myArray[l] = anArray[0], which means myArray[7] = 8.
//                  -This causes the first element from anArray to be assigned to myArray.
//                  -The process will continue until i reaches the length of anArray and myArray combined, causing all elements from anArray to be assigned to myArray.
